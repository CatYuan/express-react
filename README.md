# Express-React Tutorial

Serves the Express backend and the React single page app front end from the same application.
Based off of [this](https://medium.com/@lowewenzel/serving-express-with-a-react-single-page-app-within-the-same-application-c168f1c44201) guide.

Built from create-react-app and express-generator

To run in development mode, use `npm run dev`
To build for production, use `npm run build`

The react-app is stored in the `/react-spa` folder.

Data fetching w/ hooks in `/react-spa/src/app.js` is not fully implemented. To finish implementing, follow [this](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data) guide.
